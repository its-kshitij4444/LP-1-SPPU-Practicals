## Overview
This repository showcases practical implementations and experiments conducted in the SPOS and IoT subjects. The SPOS practicals are implemented using Python, while the IoT projects utilize Arduino for various applications. 

## SPOS Practical Codes
The SPOS practicals include various system programming tasks aimed at understanding operating system concepts. The codes are written in Python and cover topics such as:
- Two Pass Assembler (1a and 1b)
- Two Pass Macro Assembler (2a and 2b)
- Scheduling algorithms (3)
- Page Replacement Policies (4)

Each practical code is organized in its respective directory.

## IoT Projects
The IoT section features Arduino-based projects that demonstrate the principles of IoT applications. Includes
- **Temperature and Humidity Monitoring**: An Arduino project that measures temperature and humidity levels using sensors and displays the data.

Each IoT project is detailed in its own directory with the necessary code and output.

## Installation
To run the SPOS practicals, ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

For the IoT projects, you will need the following:
- An Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- Required sensors and components (as per the project requirements)
- Arduino IDE for uploading code to the Arduino board

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LP-1-SPPU-Practicals.git
